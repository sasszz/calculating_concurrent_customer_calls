## The Problem
Many companies use HS for its calling capabilities. Sales reps use the HS product throughout the day to make phone calls to prospects. We've found that certain customers using HS have a large number of sales reps concurrently making calls with HS, and this puts heavy load on our systems. In response to this, we'd like to bill our customers based on their peak calling load. In other words, we'd like to bill customers based on their maximum number of concurrent calls.

You're provided with an HTTP GET endpoint that returns phone call records represented as JSON: https://candidate.hubteam.com/candidateTest/v3/problem/dataset?userKey=71baa62a2268b783d30dbc7b1b4f. Each call looks something like this:

```json
{
  "customerId": 123,
  "callId": "2c269d25-deb9-42cf-927c-543112f7a76b",
  "startTimestamp": 1707314726000,
  "endTimestamp": 1707317769000
}
```
- `customerId` is a unique identifier for one customer. One customer may have many sales reps concurrently making calls.
- `callId` is a unique identifier for a single phone call. No two phone calls will have the same callId.
- `startTimestamp` is when the call started. This value is given as a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds. In other words, it's the number of milliseconds that passed between the UNIX epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) and the start of the call.
- `endTimestamp` is when the call ended. This value is also given as a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds. `endTimestamp` will always be greater than `startTimestamp` for a given call record.

For the billing team to charge our customers correctly, they need to know the maximum number of concurrent calls for each customer for each day. The billing team has asked you to POST this information to the following endpoint: https://candidate.hubteam.com/candidateTest/v3/problem/result?userKey=71baa62a2268b783d38dbc7b1b4f. POST body must be in the following format:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "customerId": 123,
      "date": "2024-02-07",
      "maxConcurrentCalls": 1,
      "timestamp": 1707314726000,
      "callIds": [
        "2c269d25-deb9-42cf-927c-543112f7a76b"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
- `date` is a UTC date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. So the example date refers to February 7th, 2024.
- `maxConcurrentCalls` is the maximum number of simultaneous calls that occurred at any time during the corresponding date for this customer.
- `timestamp` is a UNIX timestamp (in milliseconds) at which `maxConcurrentCalls` was reached for this customer and date. There could be multiple time periods during this date where `maxConcurrentCalls` is reached. A timestamp during any of these time periods can be chosen.
- `callIds` is an array of calls that were happening for this customer at `timestamp`. The length of this array should equal `maxConcurrentCalls`. The order of `callIds` does not matter.

This example response only has one entry in the results array, but we expect the actual answer to have multiple results.

### Note
- The `startTimestamp` of a call is inclusive, and the `endTimestamp` of a call is exclusive. This means that:
  - If call A has an `endTimestamp` of 123, and call B has a `startTimestamp` of 123, they never overlapped.
- For a given results entry, the `timestamp` should always be less than the `endTimestamp` of each call in `callIds`.
- A single call may span multiple UTC dates, and calls can be arbitrarily long.
- The order of results posted does not matter.
- For a given `customerId` and date, if no phone calls occurred during that
